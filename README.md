The city of Plutonian has been struck by deadly Z Virus.  The virus spreads through human contact. The Z virus infected a student at Elite Plutonian Institute. We assume the parasite will spread unconsciously to host&#39;s friends and periodically to friends&#39; friends with 100% probability.



Suppose that whenever a student gets infected, he transmitted it to all his friends on the following day. So, on the 1st day, the first person to be infected, transmits the Z virus to his friends; on the second day, the 1st infected person&#39;s  friends transmit to their friends; on the third day, the friends of the 1st infected person&#39;s friends tell it to their friends; and so on.



The goal is to determine:

1. Maximum no. of infected people, which is the largest number of students that, on a single day, get infected; and

2. Day of Maximum no. of infected people, which is the 1st day on which the maximum daily boom size occurs.

Write a program that, given the friendship relations between all the students in the dorm and the 1st infected student, computes the maximum daily boom size and the 1st boom day of spreading process.
